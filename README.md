## Stage 1: Addition

### Objectives

In this stage, you should write a program that:
 1. Reads matrix **A** from the input.
 2. Reads matrix **B** from the input.
 3. Outputs their sum if it is possible to add them. Otherwise, 
    it should output the `ERROR` message.

Each matrix in the input is given in the following way: the first line 
contains the number of rows ***n*** and the number of columns ***m***. 
Then ***n*** lines follow, each containing ***m*** integers representing 
one row of the matrix.

Output the result in the same way but don't print the dimensions of the 
matrix.


## Stage 2: Multiplication by number

### Objectives

Write a program that reads a matrix and a constant and outputs 
the result of their multiplication.


## Stage 3: Matrix by matrix multiplication 

 - [x] [3Blue1Brown: Essence of linear algebra (15 chapters)][Essence of linear algebra]

### Objectives

Write a program that does the following:
 1. Prints a menu consisting of 4 options and reads the user's choice.
 2. Reads all data (matrices, constants) needed to perform the chosen 
    operation.
 3. Calculates the result and outputs it.
 4. Repeats all these steps until the `"Exit"` option is chosen.
